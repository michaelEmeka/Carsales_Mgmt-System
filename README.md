CARSALES MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

This project is designed to help/aid a car sales company keep record and inventory of sold cars and cars available for sales.
It also could give account of cars available for sales in its catalog.

This project is designed to help sales representatives add cars to the inventory seamlessly and track day-to-day sales using "Sales for today" functionality and automatically generate a .txt file at closing hour.
